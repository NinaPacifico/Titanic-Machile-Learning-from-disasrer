Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster (score: 0.76555)

For this project we have two data sets. The first one, 'training.csv', contains the information of 891 passangers and shows if the passenger survived or not. The second one, 'test.csv', constains the information of 418 passengers.
Both show:
- Passenger id
- Ticket class (1,2 or 3)
- Their name
- Sex (female or male)
- Their Age
- Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic 
- Number  of parents / children aboard the Titanic
- Ticket number
- Passenger fare
- Cabin number
- Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)


We use Logistic Regression to determine if the passengers in the test data set survived or not.
